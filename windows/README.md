# Volume Shadow Copy Management (VSSManager)

A Python-based toolkit to manage Windows Volume Shadow Copies (VSS),
originally inspired by the VBS script from the "Lurking in the Shadows" 
talk by Mark Baggett and Tim Tomes.
Supports full CLI, GUI via Tkinter, modular usage, containerization with
Singularity, and Bash wrapping for integration into toolkits like ByKnocKulasT.

## ‚úÖ Features

* List, create, delete shadow copies
* Start/stop/query the VSS service
* CLI + GUI (Tkinter)
* Logging (to `vss.log`)
* Colored CLI output (`colorama`)
* Windows-compatible (requires `pywin32`)
* Works in Singularity (Windows containers)
* Importable as a Python module

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Python Environment (Windows only)

```bash
pip install pywin32 colorama
```

### Files Required

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vss.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vss_gui.py (optional GUI)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vss_tests.py (optional tests)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ singularity.def (optional container)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bash_wrapper.sh (optional wrapper)
```

---

## üöÄ CLI Usage

```bash
python vss.py --list
python vss.py --create C:
python vss.py --delete *
python vss.py --start
python vss.py --stop
python vss.py --status
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è GUI Usage (optional)

```bash
python vss_gui.py
```

---

## üß© Module Usage (Python)

```python
from vss import VSSManager
vss = VSSManager()
vss.list_shadows()
vss.create_shadow("C:")
```

---

## üì¶ Singularity (for Windows containers)

```bash
sudo singularity build vss.sif singularity.def
singularity run vss.sif --list
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Singularity with Windows containers requires a Windows host or VM.

---

## üêö Bash Wrapper (for WSL/Linux calling)

```bash
bash_wrapper.sh --list
```

---

## üìÅ Logging

All activity is logged to `vss.log` with timestamps and log levels.

---

## üìå Requirements

* Windows 10/11 or Server (32/64-bit)
* Python 3.6+
* Administrator privileges (for shadow copy actions)
* Modules: `pywin32`, `colorama`, `tkinter` (included with Python)

---

## üîê Use Case: Forensics, Incident Response, Red/Blue Teaming

Perfect for integration into forensic frameworks, IR pipelines, or adversary emulation platforms.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Authors

* Based on the VBS script by Mark Baggett & Tim "LaNMaSteR53" Tomes
* Python conversion, GUI and modular enhancements by the community
